# CNN-to-microscopy
# here we want to investigate CNN based techniques for segmenting and tracking intracellular phenotypes in fluorescence microscopic images
# with low resolution such as Neo natal rats ventricular myocytes (NRVM) nuclei, lysosomes, vesicles, cytoplasmic Ca2+ ions, and mitochodria
